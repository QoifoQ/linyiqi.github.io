## 🧾 <span style="color:#A04000"> Course Content </span> 

🖥️ **Description:**

Commercial sites such as search engines, advertisers and median (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), and financial institutions employ recommender systems for content recommendation, predicting customer behavior, compliance, or risk.

This course provides an overview of predictive models for recommender systems, including content-based collaborative algorithms, latent factor models, and deep learning models, as well as Python implementation, evaluation and metrics for recommender systems.

🔑 **Key words:**

In this course, students will learn about principles and algorithms for turning training data into effective automated predictions. We will cover:

- Python programming, recommender systems library
- Correlation-based collaborative filtering, latent factor models, neural collaborative filtering, deep learning models
- Recommender systems, link prediction, Top-K recommendation
- Tuning, bagging, ensemble in recommender systems

👌 **What you'll learn:**

- Understand principles behind recommender systems approaches such as correlation-based collaborative filtering, latent factor models, neural recommender systems
- Implement and analyze recommender systems to real applications by Python
- Choose and tune suitable models for different applications

🏗️ **Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with linear algebra (inner product, matrix-vector product), linear regression (OLS).
- At least a little experience programming with Numpy, TensorFlow, and pandas.
- Completed Machine Learning Crash Course either in-person, online, or self-study, or you have equivalent knowledge.


## 💯 <span style="color:#A04000"> Grading (tentative) </span>

👨‍💻 **Coursework:**

- Homeworks (20%)

There will be three homework / Inclass quizzes. You are encouraged to use LaTeX to submit your homework ([Latex template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/gijss-homework-template/xrhhfgqcfbft)). You will receive one (1) bonus point for submitting a typed written assignment (e.g. LaTeX, Microsoft Word). We will accept scanned handwritten assignments, but they will not receive the bonus point.

- Inclass quizzes (coding and exercise) (25%)

Open-book exam, and problems will be like the homework.

- Real application project (50%)

A full analysis provided in form of report and Jupyter notebook. (1) An executable notebook containing the performed analysis on the data; (2) A technique report includes the (i) mathematical form and intuitive interpretation of your predictive models (ii) details about the data processing and hyper-parameters tuning. 

👨🏻‍🤝‍👨🏾 **Collaboration policy**: we admit you to form a group to finish your real application projects. The number of group members should be smaller or equal than 3. The contribution of each member should be clearly stated in the final report. You will receive one (1) bonus point if you work solo to the final project.
