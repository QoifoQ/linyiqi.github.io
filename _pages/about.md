I am Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/default.aspx) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk). My main area of research is in Probabilistic Machine Learning. I work on developing novel modelling and inference methodolgies for probabilistic models, with a particular focus on Gaussian process models.

<!-- I am a final year PhD student in the [Mathematic for Real-World Systems CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at the University of Warwick, where I am currently supervised by [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/), and previously by [Rich Savage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/savage). I am also a Visiting Researcher at the London based [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), having previously done an enrichment year there. I have also completed a placement at [Prowler.io](https://www.prowler.io/) in Cambridge working with ST John and James Hensman on a research project.

<!-- I earned my Ph.D in Data Science from the
[City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and my
B.A. in Mathematics from [Hangzhou Dianzi University](http://www.hdu.edu.cn/en). -->
