# About me

My name is Yiqi Lin (林亦麒). I'm a 4-th (final) year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics, [Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/default.aspx) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk), where I am currently supervised by [Chair/Prof. Xinyuan Song](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xysong/) in Dept. STAT, and co-supervised by [Prof. Qingliang Fan](https://www.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/econ/en-gb/people/faculty?view=faculty&id=qlfan) in Dept. Econ. Previously, I was a Doctoral Visiting Researcher in [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) and cooperated with the eminent economist & statistician [Prof. Frank Windmeijer](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/professor-frank-windmeijer/) on causal inference topic of instrumental variable.

My main area of research is High-Dimension Statistics, Causal Inference, and Bayesian Statistics. My goal in research is to develop statistical methods with *reliable theoretical support*, *good empirical performance* as well as *an efficient practical algorithm* for real world problems.

Before joining the CUHK, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Statistics in [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/) at [Southern University of Science and Technology]([http://www.hdu.edu.cn/](https://sustech.edu.cn/index.html)) in 2019.

<!-- I am a final year PhD student in the [Mathematic for Real-World Systems CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at the University of Warwick, where I am currently supervised by [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/), and previously by [Rich Savage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/savage). I am also a Visiting Researcher at the London based [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), having previously done an enrichment year there. I have also completed a placement at [Prowler.io](https://www.prowler.io/) in Cambridge working with ST John and James Hensman on a research project. My main area of research is in Probabilistic Machine Learning. I work on developing novel modelling and inference methodolgies for probabilistic models, with a particular focus on Gaussian process models. -->
