# About me

My name is Ben Dai (戴奔). I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/default.aspx) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk). My main area of research is developing a Statistical Machine Learning Method with *reliable theoretical supports*, *good empirical performance* and *a scalable software*.

Prior to joining the CUHK, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the [School of Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics) at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), under the supervision of [Xiaotong Shen](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~xshen/) and [Wei Pan](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/). I received my PhD degree in [Data Science](https://www.sdsc.cityu.edu.hk/) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2019, advised by [Junhui Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/junhuiwang). Prior to CityU, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at [Hangzhou Dianzi University](http://www.hdu.edu.cn/) in 2015.

<!-- I am a final year PhD student in the [Mathematic for Real-World Systems CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at the University of Warwick, where I am currently supervised by [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/), and previously by [Rich Savage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/savage). I am also a Visiting Researcher at the London based [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), having previously done an enrichment year there. I have also completed a placement at [Prowler.io](https://www.prowler.io/) in Cambridge working with ST John and James Hensman on a research project. My main area of research is in Probabilistic Machine Learning. I work on developing novel modelling and inference methodolgies for probabilistic models, with a particular focus on Gaussian process models. -->

[City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and my
B.A. in Mathematics from [Hangzhou Dianzi University](http://www.hdu.edu.cn/en). -->
