# About me

My name is Yiqi Lin (Êûó‰∫¶È∫í), and I obtained my Ph.D. in [Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/default.aspx) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk). My research is supervised by [Chair/Prof. Xinyuan Song](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xysong/) in the Department of Statistics, and co-supervised by [Prof. Qingliang Fan](https://www.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/econ/en-gb/people/faculty?view=faculty&id=qlfan) in the Department of Economics. Previously, I was a Doctoral Visiting Researcher at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), where I collaborated with the renowned economist and statistician [Prof. Frank Windmeijer](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/professor-frank-windmeijer/) on causal inference using instrumental variables.

Currently, I am a Quantitative Researcher at Qube Research and Technologies (QRT), focusing on mid/low-frequency global equity strategies.

My main research interests encompass High-Dimensional Statistics, Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Bayesian Statistics. I aim to develop statistical methods that have *reliable theoretical support, good empirical performance, and efficient practical algorithms* for real-world problems.

<!--Prior to joining CUHK, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Statistics from the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/) at the [Southern University of Science and Technology]([http://www.hdu.edu.cn/](https://sustech.edu.cn/index.html)) in 2019.-->
